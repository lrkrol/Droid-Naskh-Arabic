# Droid Naskh+Serif 

Extended version of Droid Arabic Naskh using Droid Serif.

The Apache-licensed [Droid Arabic Naskh](https://github.com/jenskutilek/free-fonts/tree/master/Droid/Droid Arabic Naskh/TTF) font lacks basic punctuation, mathematical operators, Latin characters, et cetera. Droid Naskh+Serif extends Droid Arabic Naskh by merging it with Apache-licensed [Droid Serif](https://github.com/jenskutilek/free-fonts/tree/master/Droid/Droid Serif/TTF) for increased coverage. This was done using [FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge).

See also the [Sahl Naskh](https://github.com/khaledhosny/sahl-naskh) font which merges the same two fonts and applies some fixes to the Arabic set, but does not contain Greek or Cyrillic.
